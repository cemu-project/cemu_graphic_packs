Some graphic packs might not be available for Cemu 1.14.0 and newer while previous versions did have graphic packs.
This is due to the full reimplementation of the texture system in Cemu 1.14.0.
This also changed a lot of the aspects with textures and made all previous graphic packs that changed textures outdated.

Hence, why some games have their graphic packs missing in the new versions for now..
You can search which games are supported above or see [this project page](https://github.com/slashiee/cemu_graphic_packs/projects/5?fullscreen=true) for more detailed information.
