Here we'll repeat some info from above in a more detailed step-by-step guide of how to install graphic packs. This assumes you use the manual method of installing packs, and not the built-in automatic graphic pack downloader/updater.

1. Choose one of the 3 downloads from above. Each download has a range of versions it supports, pick the one that's supported by your downloaded Cemu version.
2. Right-click on the `graphicPacks307.zip` and click "Extract all..." to extract all of the contents to a new folder.
3. Afterwards, open that folder you've just extracted it to and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> to select all the folders and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy the files.
4. Browse to your Cemu folder and open the `graphicPacks` folder. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to paste your copied folders.
5. Go to `Options`->`Graphic packs` after you've started Cemu and enable the packs you want to use.
