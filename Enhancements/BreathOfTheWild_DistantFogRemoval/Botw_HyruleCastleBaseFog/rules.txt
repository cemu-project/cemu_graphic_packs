# Information
# by SkalFate
# ----------------------
# (basefogopacity) = Fog Transparency/Opacity - how thick you want the Hyrule Castle Base Fog to look
# ------ Values are multiplied, so if you want to lower use [0.01 - 1.0], or if you want to go higher go from [1.0 - X.X]

# (basefogred, basefoggreen, basefogblue ) = RGB - Red, Green, Blue -  Changes the color of the Hyrule Base Fog.
# ------ Values are multiplied so if you want to lower use [0.01 - 1.0], or if you want to go higher go from [1.0 - X.X]
