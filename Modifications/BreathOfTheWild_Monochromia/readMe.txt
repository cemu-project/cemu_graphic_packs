Monochromia - Sin City inspired Mod
This mod makes almost everything in the game black and white. Only the bright lights and other special effects remain with full color. 

!!! Important !!!
Delete/rename the a5b3a5e5ab2938bc file from your resolution pack, otherwise it gets overriden and the clouds will appear coloured.
The AA fix is implemented in this pack as well. Remember to restore the file in your resolution pack when not using this mod.
This mod is not compatible with Clarity/Contrasty, as this mod uses custom postprocessing. Delete bd8bba59e2149449 from this pack if you wish to use those.

The full color can be restored on certain elements as well, such as characters or trees/plants. 
You can do that by renaming/deleting the corresponding shader files (effectively disabling the overide) listed below.
Some shaders also have a color fade effect implemented. This effect keeps full color nearby, and fades to black and white with distance.
This can be enabled by setting ENABLE_COLOR_FADE to 1. Only the first 7 shaders in the list have this flag.

This is a postprocessing shader, a preset I created that is tuned for black/white. You can adjust the some values, or you can replace it entirely with the one from Clarity
