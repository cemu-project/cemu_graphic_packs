This is based on an extreme simplification of the fps++ mod by Xalphenos; it 
drops dynamic FPS to get back stability. The Rajkosto "best fence" method is 
also included for performance and stability. It improves over the previous 
static fps mod because it allows ANY value as a static fps target and it
also includes the stamina fix.

To use it simply grab one of the uploaded versions or edit one with these
changes: a) rules.txt frequency and name b) divide 30 by the target FPS c) use
the result of that calculation and the target fps in patches.txt.

Disclaimer: this is different from the static FPS mod ported recently. The main
advantage of this one is that it allows ANY static FPS instead of only 60, 30,
20.. and it also includes the stamina fix.
