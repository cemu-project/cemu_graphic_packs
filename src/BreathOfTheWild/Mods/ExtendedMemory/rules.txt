# If you've got any improvements for this pack (since it's currently work-in-progress), please let us know in the Cemu Graphic Packs github (https://github.com/cemu-project/cemu_graphic_packs) via an issue.
# Also, it'd be appreciated if the code for this graphic pack wasn't included inside of mods for the sake of mod compatibility.
