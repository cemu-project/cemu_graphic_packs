name = Anti-Aliasing Pack
path = "Xenoblade Chronicles X/Enhancements/Anti-Aliasing"
description = Allows you to modify the game's existing anti-aliasing solution or replace it with the universally supported Nvidia FXAA solution. This changes how the games gets rid of jagged edges to make sharp edges look better.||Made by SkalFate, modified by Intra.

# Subpix:
# Choose the amount of sub-pixel aliasing removal.
# This affects how sharp or smooth you want the image to be.
#   1.00 - upper limit (softer)
#   0.75 - default amount of filtering
#   0.50 - lower limit (sharper, less sub-pixel aliasing removal)
#   0.25 - almost off
#   0.00 - completely off

# EdgeThreshold:
# The minimum amount of local contrast required to apply algorithm.
#   0.333 - too little (faster)
#   0.250 - low quality
#   0.166 - default
#   0.125 - high quality
#   0.063 - overkill (slower)

# EdgeThresholdMin:
# Trims the algorithm from processing darks.
#   0.0833 - upper limit (default, the start of visible unfiltered edges)
#   0.0625 - high quality (faster)
#   0.0312 - visible limit (slower)

# FXAA Quality Preset
# 10 to 15 - default medium dither (10=fastest, 15=highest quality)
# 20 to 29 - less dither, more expensive (20=fastest, 29=highest quality)
# 39       - no dither, very expensive

# Green As Luma
# This will turn off AA on anything which lacks some amount of green.
# Pure red and blue or combination of only R and B, will get no AA.
# 1 = On.
# 0 = Off.
