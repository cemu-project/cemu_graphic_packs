description = Decrease the ground damage done by your team. I wanted to increase the challenge of the main story but the Enemy Stat Multiplier Mod made them hit way too hard. Note: displayed damage isn't affected so in practice it feels more like multiplying the enemy's health, but internally it's really the damage which is divided. Note 2: Haven't tested it for skells, but it probably won't work since the Damage Mod Multiplier doesn't. Note 3: I'm no /u/lasyan3 and frankly I had no idea what I was doing lol. Unexpected behaviour might show up. Nothing happened to me so far though.
