description = This mod by default only applies 2 Quality of Life changes. It sets your Tension points to their max once at boot, and prevents your Skell GP from draining while your outside it.||On top of the QoL changes, this mod also features very extensive ways to customize the way your HP and TP are handled by the game that veteran players may enjoy.
