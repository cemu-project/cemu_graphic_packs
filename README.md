### Information
------
Cemu Graphic Packs is a repository where you can find graphic packs that can upscale and improve most Wii U games that work on [Cemu](http://cemu.info/).

It's made by the Cemu community so you're also free to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/slashiee/cemu_graphic_packs/wiki/How-to-create-resolution-packs) if you wish.

Graphic packs that modify game files can be found [here](https://github.com/slashiee/cemu_graphic_packs/wiki/Game-Mods).

### Downloads
The latest downloads are **always** found on our [website](https://slashiee.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/)!
