#define THRESHOLD $Threshold //32

// The range (in source pixels) at which to sample for neighbours. Higher values
// will find more gradients, but lower values will deband more aggressively.
#define RANGE $Range //16

// The number of debanding iterations to perform. Each iteration samples from
// random positions, so increasing the number of iterations is likely to
// increase the debanding quality. Conversely, it slows the shader down.
// (Each iteration will use a multiple of the configured RANGE, and a
// successively lower THRESHOLD - so setting it much higher has little effect)
#define ITERATIONS $Iterations //4

// (Optional) Add some extra noise to the image. This significantly helps cover
// up remaining banding and blocking artifacts, at comparatively little visual
// quality. Higher = more grain. Setting it to 0 disables the effect.
#define GRAIN $Grain //10

// Note: If performance is too slow, try eg. RANGE=16 ITERATIONS=2. In general,
// an increase in the number of ITERATIONS should roughly correspond to a
// decrease in RANGE and perhaps an increase in THRESHOLD.
//------------ End of configuration ------------
