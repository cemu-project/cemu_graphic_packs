#We don't have access to alpha or depth, just contrast detection with green channel as alpha substitute
#Since games have different styles there are no "correct" values.
#3200x1800 looks a lot worse than 3840x2160. Maybe N x 16 res is preferable?


#FXAA_QUALITY_PRESET
# 10 to 15 - default medium dither (10=fastest, 15=highest quality) //mostly relevant for Cemu
# 20 to 29 - less dither, more expensive (20=fastest, 29=highest quality)
# 39       - no dither, very expensive //maybe for memory constrained scenarios?

# [0.000 to 1.000]
#Subpix:0.01 slowest -> 0.9 fastest -  ?? -> More
#EdgeThreshold contrast cut off: 0.01 slowest -> 0.9 fastest - More edges processing -> Less
#EdgeThresholdMin black cut off: 0.01 slowest -> 0.9 fastest - Don't process below. Note green cutoff, as we don't have alpha

#Cheers Skalfate, I'd prob never would have done this without your Xeno AA port.
