name = 60FPS with 3/4P splitscreen mode
path = "Mario Kart 8/Mods/60FPS in splitscreen"
description = Forces the game to run at 60FPS instead of the 30FPS in 3-4P splitscreen. In those splitscreen modes, it normally alternates each side of the screen in one frame. This forces it to draw both sides instead.
