# (ffopacity) = Fog Transparency/Opacity - how thick you want the fog fields to look
# 0 = transparent
# ------ Values are multiplied, so if you want to lower use [0.01 - 1.0], or if you want to go higher go from [1.0 - X.X]

# (ffred, ffgreen, ffblue ) = RGB - Red, Green, Blue - Changes the color of the fog fields.
