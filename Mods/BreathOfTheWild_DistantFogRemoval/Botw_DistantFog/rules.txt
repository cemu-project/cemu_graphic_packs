# Information
# by SkalFate
# ----------------------
# Distant lighting  - is for distant area lighting of the land and how far in the distance everything is lit up
# ------ Values are multiplied, so if you want to lower use 0.01-1.0, or if you want to go higher go from 1.0-X.X

# Greenery lighting - is the same as above but for trees vines, bushes
# ------ Values are multiplied, so if you want to lower use 0.01-1.0, or if you want to go higher go from 1.0-X.X

# RGB - Red, Green, Blue - is self explanatory for the color of the fog, trees, water.
# ------ Values are multiplied so if you want to lower use 0.01-1.0, or if you want to go higher go from 1.0-X.X
