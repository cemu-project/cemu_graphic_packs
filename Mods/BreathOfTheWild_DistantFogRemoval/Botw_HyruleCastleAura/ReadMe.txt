$aurared = 1

# (aurafog) -- Fog over Ganons Aura.
# ------------ 0 = disabled , 1 = Enabled

# (auraopacity) -- How opaque do you want the color strenght to be.
# ---------------- 0 = Transparent , Values from 1x to 100x

# (aurared, auragreen, aurablue ) = RGB - Red, Green, Blue - allows for chaning the color of the Aura.
# ------ Values are multiplied so if you want to lower use [0.01 - 1.0], or if you want to go higher go from [1.0 - X.X]
